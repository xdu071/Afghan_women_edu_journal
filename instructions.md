### Challenge 2 Data Journalism

You are team of data journalists working for a data viz consulting company contracted by the BBC.  We (the teaching team) as editors for the BBC website have contracted you to find a news-worthy story on a topic of your choice excluding Covid or Brexit as our readership are overwhelmed by those news topics at the moment.  Any other data story topics are encouraged!  You need to work as a team to pitch to us your story and we will only fund the successful pitches!

Here is a blog post from the BBC data visualisation team so you can read more about us:

Here is a bit about our R package - you don’t need to use it, but you might be interested!

What you need to do is:
- Find a story with publicly available data (excluding Covid, the US election or Brexit).
- Develop your key message.
- Build and present a workflow.
- Create your data visualisation - one figure appropriate for display on the BBC website in a news story.
- Provide a well organised repository with your data, script, figure, informative markdown, licence and any other relevant information.

Think about:
- the colour scheme
- the flow of information
- the number of panels
- the figure and caption text
- any figure annotations
- appropriate crediting for the sources for the data

Your figure can include multiple plot panels, text, icons and other elements as you see appropriate, but it all has to be generated with code. You should include a figure caption to go with the figure to explain the main message and the news story, which can be presented with your figure in a markdown document.

You and your team will be working within the same group repository. You can decide on how you design your workflow, but the workflow must be included in your repostitory on GitHub.

You are required to show evidence of your project management and discussions. We suggest that you explore using the Project tab on GitHub and manage your team work that way, but you can use alternative means as well, though it has to all be on GitHub and in your challenge group repository.

### Assessment criteria

__Challenge:__ Effectiveness of communication and formatting of the data visualisation and pitch of the story. Appropriate use of colour, text, figure type and caption text to communicate the messages. Appropriate crediting and permissions for data sources. Appropriate use of the ggplot2 package, ggplot2 themes, any ggplot2 extension packages you might decide to use and the dataset. - 25%

__Creativity:__ Creative data visualisation and use of the data to communicate an interesting news-worthy story. Creative use of data visualisation techniques to communicate the findings in the data. Creative way of pitching the story in your markdown file. - 25%

__Reproducibility:__ Clear structure to the repository, a logical and clear workflow, well-formatted and structured code with informative comments and and appropriate coding etiquette. - 25%

__Participation:__ Clear evidence of team work with division of tasks, team members providing feedback on each other’s work and overall achievement of the challenge objectives. - 25%

### The groups
Note: Most groups have six people and one group has seven people. We will expect ~1/7 more work for the group with seven people in it representing the size of your team, but the criteria for the assignment stay the same. Each student will get an individual mark based on the work they contribute to the overall group work, which we will track in GitHub. Remember to use GitHub for all of your communications and work so that we can track everyone's individual contributions!
